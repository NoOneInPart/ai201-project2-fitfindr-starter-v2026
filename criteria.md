# Acceptance criteria — FitFindr

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this agent, written in unit 3
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"The agent handles errors"* is an opinion.
*"When search returns nothing, the agent stops before calling the second tool,
in 5 of 5 tries"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter one. A reason that says something about your tools, your loop, or the
data earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

**Two are written for you. You write three.**

## 1. A matching query completes all three tools

Given a query that matches at least one listing, the agent completes all three
tool calls and returns a fit card — in at least 4 of 5 tries.

**Why this target:**
<!-- Why 4 of 5 and not 5 of 5? Something about your search, probably —
     "my search is a plain keyword match and some phrasings will miss" is a
     real answer. -->
The search tool works by finding keyword matches in the description as well as direct size and price matches. It should work reliably as the codepath is deterministic, however, a natural input is not deterministic and may not always yield exact matches if the search description doesn't nicely match that of the intended listing, so 4 out of 5 allows some leeway for this possibility.

## 2. An impossible query stops before the second tool

Given a query that matches no listings, the agent stops before calling
`suggest_outfit` and returns a message naming what to change — 5 of 5 tries.

**Why this target:**
<!-- Why is 5 of 5 reasonable here when criterion 1 isn't? What's different
     about this path? -->
The query is specifically designed to be nowhere close to the existing listings, and the search tool consists of deterministic codes that checks for keyword matches and exact price/size matches. It should not be able to return something if nothing is supposed to match, thus, this criteria must be met for 5 of 5 tries.

## 3. Something about state

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE.

     How would you know that the item your search found is the same item the
     next tool received? Name something countable or observable.

     This is the criterion people find hardest, because state failure doesn't
     look like state failure — it looks like a tool problem. Something that
     compares session["selected_item"] against what actually reached
     suggest_outfit is the shape you're after. -->

session["selected_item"]["id"] should match session["search_results"][0]["id"], and all original listing fields (id, title, price, platform, size) are intact for all 5 of 5 tries.


**Why this target:**
5 out of 5 should be realistic because passing the data along should be accomplished through deterministic code and not a non-deterministic LLM; if there's a problem with the information not being the same, there is a bug.



---

## 4. Something about the fit card

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE.

     The fit card calls a model, so the same input can produce different words
     each time. That's not a bug — it's the nature of the tool. So what would
     make it acceptable?

     Think about what you'd actually be unhappy to see. A caption that never
     mentions the price? Two different items producing the same opening
     sentence? A card longer than a caption anyone would post? Any of those can
     be turned into a number. -->

Fit card captions explicitly include both the platform name and item price in 4 of 5 runs.

**Why this target:**
Tool prompts should explicitly instruct the model to include both the platform name and item price in the returned result, but due to the non-deterministic nature of LLMs, 4 out of 5 allows the small models used to accidentally drop one or more of these parts since it isn't explicitly a problem with the code.


---

## 5. Your choice

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE TOO.

     Pick something you actually care about getting right. Speed, the empty
     wardrobe path, what happens when the model can't be reached, whether the
     search respects a price ceiling — anything, as long as it names a number
     or an observable outcome. -->

For a valid query but an empty wardrobe, the agent should successfully complete the run and return a fit card with general styling advice without breaking for 5 of 5 runs.

**Why this target:**
5 of 5 should be realistic as that part can be handled deterministically in suggest_outfit, specifically prompting the model to give some styling advice with an empty wardrobe versus prompting the model to find suggested outfits if there is a wardrobe.

     UNIT 4 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 4. Something about the fit card

         The fit card is different every time.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 4:** For 5 different items, the 5 fit cards share
         > no opening sentence.
         >
         > **Why revised:** "different" wasn't checkable — two cards that
         > differed by one word still counted. The new version is something I
         > can actually score.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said the empty search stops it 5 of 5 times, but I got 3 of 5,
            so 3 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.
